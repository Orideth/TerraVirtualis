This project lays out research bases systems and practices for art, cultural, and historic education within a virtual environment. The project unifies pedagogical methods by utilizing technology to create cohesion and improve student outcomes. Terra is an open-world walking simulator that provides users with curated educational experiences.

The Mission of the project is twofold:

Identify and implement features of widely accepted educational methodologies and paradigm that are most suitable for fully-virtual learning environments.

Demonstrate the benefits and possibilities of virtual environments for arts and education as well as propose solutions for global issues such as the high cost of arts education, the slow embrace of digital art as an enduring and formative media, and the art-as-investment market mindset that has shifted art from a primary consumption market to an unregulated speculative market.
